<br/>

### - 🛸 **'Outta This World' speed**

<br/>

**Scoop Super Search** is capable of searching in more than 800 buckets and 52,000 app manifests in internet. It uses the lightning fast [ScoopMaster database](https://github.com/okibcn/ScoopMaster) to provide intantaneous results in less than 500 ms.

<br/>

### - ⭐ **Always updated**
<br/>

**Scoop Super Search** uses the [ScoopMaster database](https://github.com/okibcn/ScoopMaster), ensuring the latest results and highest versions for every app in Scoop. The database is updated every 30 minutes, ensuring fresh results, newer than even the official scoop app database.

<br/>

### - 🔍 **Searches in names AND descriptions improving the search flexibility.**
<br/>

Most Scoop search tools provide results only referred to the app name. SS can search also in the app descriptions.

<br/>

### - 🔍&🔍 **Match All keywords capability.**

<br/>

### - 🕒 **Last-manifest filter**

**SS** can provide the output as a PSObject format so other PowerShell utilities could use the data for other tasks.
